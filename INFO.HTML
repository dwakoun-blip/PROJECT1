        <p>
            

Amber Fort, also called Amer Fort, is a grand historical fort built on a hill in Amer, about 11 km from Jaipur in Rajasthan. The construction of the fort was started by Raja Man Singh I in 1592, one of the most trusted generals of Mughal Emperor Akbar. Later, Mirza Raja Jai Singh and Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II expanded and improved the fort. Made with red sandstone and white marble, the fort beautifully mixes Rajput and Mughal architecture. Inside the fort are many iconic sections like Diwan-i-Aam, Diwan-i-Khas, the beautiful Ganesh Pol gate and the famous Sheesh Mahal (Mirror Palace), where small mirror pieces reflect light like stars. Before Jaipur city was established, Amber Fort served as the main royal residence of the Kachwaha Rajput rulers. Today, Amber Fort is a UNESCO World Heritage site, known worldwide for its history, architecture, light and sound show, and elephant rides, making it a major tourist attraction.

Hawa Mahal, also known as the “Palace of Winds”, is one of the most iconic monuments in Jaipur, Rajasthan. It was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, and designed by the architect Lal Chand Ustad. Made of red and pink sandstone, it reflects the beautiful Rajput architectural style. The structure has five floors and around 953 small windows called “jharokhas”. These windows allow cool breeze to pass inside, which made the palace comfortable during hot summers. The main purpose of Hawa Mahal was to allow royal women to observe street festivals, markets and everyday life from behind the windows without being seen, because during that time, women followed the purdah system. The front of the palace looks like a honeycomb of a beehive, which makes it very unique. Today, Hawa Mahal is one of the most popular tourist attractions of Jaipur and is an important symbol of the Pink City’s culture and heritage.

            <p>
                
Jal Mahal, meaning “Water Palace”, is one of the most beautiful historical monuments of Jaipur, Rajasthan. It is located in the middle of Man Sagar Lake, between Jaipur and Amer. The palace was originally built in the 18th century by Maharaja Madho Singh I as a summer retreat and a place for royal duck-hunting parties. Jal Mahal is made using Rajput style of architecture with some Mughal influences. The palace looks like it is floating on water, but actually it has five floors, out of which four floors remain underwater when the lake is full, and only the top floor remains visible.

Jal Mahal cannot be visited from the inside today, but visitors can enjoy its stunning view from the banks of the lake. At night, when the palace lights reflect on the water, the view becomes even more magical. Jal Mahal is one of Jaipur’s most photographed tourist attractions.

        <p>
            
Nahargarh Fort is a majestic hilltop fort located on the Aravalli hills, overlooking Jaipur city in Rajasthan.
