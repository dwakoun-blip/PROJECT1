            <h1> Dal Bhati Churma </h1>
            <p> **Dal Baati Churma** is one of the most iconic and beloved dishes of Jaipur and the wider Rajasthani cuisine. It is a wholesome combination of three components: **baati**, **dal**, and **churma**. Baati are round, hard wheat rolls baked or roasted to perfection, giving them a crisp exterior and soft interior. These are served with **dal**, typically made from lentils and flavored with aromatic spices, creating a savory and comforting taste. Churma, the sweet element of the dish, is made by crushing baked baati and mixing it with ghee and jaggery or sugar, offering a delightful contrast to the savory dal and baati. This dish not only represents the culinary richness of Rajasthan but also reflects the ingenuity of using simple ingredients to create a filling and flavorsome meal. Dal Baati Churma is often enjoyed during festivals and special occasions, making it a must-try for anyone visiting Jaipur.
